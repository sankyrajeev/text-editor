# text-editor

## Description 

This project is a demonstration of a single page application which meets Progressive Web Application criteria. This app is capable of running offline just as well as online. This project began with an existing application which was implimented with an IndexedDB database. With this application, I learned about the capabilities of a module-compatible system with the webpack plugin. I also learned how to use idb, a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. The application also uses bebel in order to use async/await within the application. The most challenging aspect of this project was that working with module-compatible systems was very new to me. The coolest aspect of this project was being able to download an application and seeing it render as an idcon on my desktop. Having a registered service worker using workbox allowed me to have my static assets pre cached.
